# Twispack

A WordPress starter theme with TailwindCSS v4 & Rspack, made for heavy custom development from scratch. Crappy, crabbily fast, and unnecessarily edgy.

## Development

`npm i`
`npm run build`

## Credits

I copy and modify `index.php` and `functions.php` from https://github.com/davidegreenwald/Bare-Minimum
